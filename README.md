# Another_DnD_simulator
I was so excited with Dungeons an Dragons (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) so i decided to make my own version of this legendry game. By mentioning D&D I mean 5-th redaction.
By now there is only console version. But I'm going to add Gui and then graphics.
Versions shows how many things I have done yet in comparison with what I planed.
(Version 1.0 - fully implemented all what I wanted in very begining)

Version 0.0.79
It is not even beta build so don`t expect too much from my project.

In this version You can make your character, choose its class race background and so on.
You can buy yourself a gear, equip something on you. And save your party after that.
You can Load your party and check all parameters. And thats all for now.
Maybe I forgot about something, you can find it yourself :3
Not everything needed is implemented, warlock still needs a pet, wizard and other spellcasters needs spells.
But as I mentioned earlier I`m developing this game and I hope that I will add this in future versions.
